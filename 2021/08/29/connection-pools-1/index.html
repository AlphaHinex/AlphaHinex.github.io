<p>Today we are going to talk about connecting to the database and</p>
<p>how we choose connect to the database.</p>
<p>In previous YouTube videos, we’ve shown<br>how</p>
<p>developers might connect to the database,<br>and how they would use</p>
<p>cursors and arrays, and things like that. But we are going to do a</p>
<p>topic that really should be thought about from both the system administrator</p>
<p>and the system architect. And it’s the number of connections that we make to the database</p>
<p>and how they connect to the database. Are<br>those connections permanent</p>
<p>or are they dynamic? This is a topic that my colleagues within the Real World Performance group</p>
<p>have been dealing with for<br>probably the best part of 20 years.</p>
<p>And basically</p>
<p>it’s done wrong in many cases, and it’s<br>usually done wrong</p>
<p>because of over-optimistic views</p>
<p>of how they think the database can just<br>keep on</p>
<p>absorbing more and more connections. The reality of the situation is</p>
<p>that there’s two things at stake here. One the database–you cannot add</p>
<p>an infinite number connections to the<br>database. And</p>
<p>the second thing is the number of<br>connections to the database should ideally</p>
<p>be static–should be the same number all<br>time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, today’s applications<br>tend to get built in middle tiers</p>
<p>and they tend to specify dynamic<br>connection pools. Very often it’s a</p>
<p>minimum number and then maximum number.</p>
<p>And there’s under…. people are under this illusion that basically</p>
<p>the applications servers will keep on<br>creating connections as required,</p>
<p>and they’ll potentially cut them back if the load goes off.</p>
<p>Well in fact this is actually the worst<br>thing possible to do.</p>
<p>In fact, one of my colleagues often defines this sort of architecture</p>
<p>as a “gun ready to go off.” You have the<br>potential to rapidly create a large</p>
<p>number</p>
<p>connections. We have the ability to<br>basically</p>
<p>destabilize the entire database<br>environment.</p>
<p>And for this reason itself, um,</p>
<p>we actually got quite tired of talking to<br>people about this.</p>
<p>And for this reason we built demos and<br>we</p>
<p>built graphical screens to actually show<br>what happens</p>
<p>when the load comes on the system. So to<br>demonstrate the</p>
<p>the challenges associated with both a<br>large connection pool and a</p>
<p>dynamic connection pool, what we’re going to do is we are going to simulate load coming on a system</p>
<p>in slow motion. So we can actually</p>
<p>watch and interrogate a system  as the load comes up.</p>
<p>The reasoning being for that is that if we see in slow motion</p>
<p>we can actually see what is happening<br>and watch the system fall apart in</p>
<p>front of you rather than it all<br>happening in two seconds</p>
<p>and system just falling over and everyone<br>curious as to what has happened.</p>
<p>And this it becomes particularly<br>important</p>
<p>to understand what is happening and how<br>quickly these things</p>
<p>can run out of control. So and</p>
<p>we’re back using the Real World Performance demo screens</p>
<p>and you’ll notice we have basically</p>
<p>three windows down the middle which is<br>reporting what we’re doing. Now we have a</p>
<p>very stable system here,</p>
<p>running at this point in time. You can<br>notice that the response time from the</p>
<p>applications</p>
<p>is two milliseconds. We’re running at<br>quite a modest transaction rate of just</p>
<p>under 2,000 transactions a second.</p>
<p>But let’s talk about what our user<br>community is doing. What we actually have</p>
<p>is nearly 15,000 individual Java threads</p>
<p>all playing effectively cards online.</p>
<p>And they’re</p>
<p>basically pressing the button,<br>each thread, once every 10 seconds.</p>
<p>What we’ve done is we’ve created a<br>connection pool that can</p>
<p>literally go out of control and destabilize<br>the system.</p>
<p>The initial connection pool was a 144<br>connections to the database, but we’re going</p>
<p>let it grow</p>
<p>to 6,000 connections to the database</p>
<p>when the load comes on. Now if we look at the system at the moment you can see we’re</p>
<p>barely recording anything on the AWR<br>report or ASH reports.</p>
<p>The CPU utilization is extremely low.</p>
<p>And the other thing to notice is that<br>even though the</p>
<p>utilization on the system is extremely<br>low, we’ve already</p>
<p>extended the connection pool at over 200<br>connections to the database</p>
<p>up from 144, just because the<br>application servers</p>
<p>occasionally found that all their connections were busy, we allowed it to grow.</p>
<p>And with that in mind and I’m going to</p>
<p>force it to grow even more. And we are going to watch the system as we start to grow.</p>
<p>So I’m going to start doubling up the work load, so instead of everyone</p>
<p>pressing the button every 10 seconds,<br>we are now going to make it every five seconds.</p>
<p>And we’ll double this up.</p>
<p>And I’m going to continue to double this up until it gets quite</p>
<p>interesting and we’ve actually started to make the system yield.</p>
<p>At this point just doubling up the<br>workload, you can see that there’s just a</p>
<p>tiny</p>
<p>increment in the workload, the transaction<br>rate is doubling,</p>
<p>the response time hasn’t been impacted<br>it all,</p>
<p>we’re starting to see a little bit of climb on<br>the CPU utilization,</p>
<p>which we can see we’re barely even using<br>seven or eight</p>
<p>percent of the system this point in time. So let’s double it up</p>
<p>in another step.</p>
<p>And again, here we go doubled up the<br>workload again. And</p>
<p>at this point in time, we can see very<br>linear behavior</p>
<p>on the system. We’re seeing the<br>transaction rate literally</p>
<p>double with each step. We’re barely<br>impacting</p>
<p>response time. And we’re seeing the CPU getting proportional response</p>
<p>coming up as the workload comes up.</p>
<p>So, at this point in time, people will<br>start to think we’ve built a linear and</p>
<p>a scaleable system. The other thing to note</p>
<p>is that we are starting to see the connections to the database</p>
<p>and the size of the connection pool now is now approaching nearly 500, okay.</p>
<p>So we are really about four times bigger</p>
<p>nearly five times bigger than the<br>initial connection pool,</p>
<p>yet we’ve hardly stretch the machine at all.</p>
<p>So there’s a lot of connections that<br>actually aren’t doing anything</p>
<p>in fact</p>
<p>is 465 at this point in time, where we are not actually doing anything at all.</p>
<p>We’ve only got 16 active. And this is on a<br>machine here</p>
<p>with actually twenty four cores on. So<br>you can see we’re</p>
<p>not even fully utilizing the machine in<br>terms of sessions per</p>
<p>core at this point. But you can see, again,</p>
<p>that connection count is increasing just<br>because you get occasional</p>
<p>timing glitches where of all the 32<br>JVMs that</p>
<p>we have driving this application, all the<br>connections are</p>
<p>busy for one point in time and so we just<br>popped another connection.</p>
<p>So let’s double up the workload a little<br>bit more, and then we should start</p>
<p>getting into start seeing</p>
<p>load come onto the system a little bit<br>more seriously.</p>
<p>So we’re doubling it up now,</p>
<p>and we are starting to push the transaction<br>rate</p>
<p>much higher. We are getting up into the<br>15-16</p>
<p>thousand transactions per second. Thing<br>to note here, you starting to see a much</p>
<p>more</p>
<p>noticeable increase in the CPU on the<br>system,</p>
<p>and we’re approaching at this point 25<br>percent utilization on the system.</p>
<p>But again nothing to see in database on<br>ASH report,</p>
<p>not much to see of the user response time.<br>This is the point in time</p>
<p>where very often we see system architects and administrators</p>
<p>congratulating each other because they<br>think, “wow we’ve got this </p>
<p>scaleable system.”  But it’s only<br>scaleable to </p>
<p>25 percent utilization of the database server. That’s</p>
<p>hardly the best utilization of hardware<br>resources,</p>
<p>software licenses. So let’s double up<br>again</p>
<p>and see where get to when we start. Hopefully, now that we’re going to get</p>
<p>to use 50 percent of the utilization on the<br>machine.</p>
<p>So we’re doubling up again and we can<br>see,</p>
<p>again, a very immediate response. The<br>transaction rate is doubling.</p>
<p>We are seeing the CPU workload doubling. And we’re nearly at</p>
<p>50 percent utilization on the system.<br>Barely an increase on the system</p>
<p>response time. Again a very stable system.</p>
<p>The thing to note now is we really are<br>starting to grow a lot more connections to the</p>
<p>database,</p>
<p>is the middleware is now getting to<br>situation. It is running at a higher rate</p>
<p>and the statistical chance that all the<br>connections used from one JVM</p>
<p>being in use is increasing all the time. So literally as I’ve been speaking, we’re seeing the</p>
<p>connections pop to</p>
<p>over nearly 2000 here. We are at 1900</p>
<p>as I spoke, before we were in the<br>hundreds,</p>
<p>and within a second or so, I imagine we are going to be</p>
<p>greater than 2000 fairly quickly. But you can see quite quickly that</p>
<p>you know, still at this point in time the<br>system is very predictable,</p>
<p>very linear, and everyone seeming great. And this is at the point where</p>
<p>we’re about fifty percent utilization on the system.</p>
<p>Now at fifty percent utilization on the<br>system,</p>
<p>we can see this is a point where our<br>statistical chance of getting scheduled</p>
<p>is 2 in 1. As I crank up the<br>utilization on the system,</p>
<p>your chance of getting scheduled<br>immediately</p>
<p>is starting to get reduced. We are starting to not get scheduled all of the</p>
<p>time. We are going to start seeing more variation in the response time.</p>
<p>As the response time varies, we are more likely to have</p>
<p>more application servers waiting.</p>
<p>And they are more likely to initiate more<br>connections.</p>
<p>So you can see as we crank up the<br>utilization</p>
<p>we can more likely to basically get more<br>variable response time,</p>
<p>which is going to force the app servers<br>to throw more connections at the database,</p>
<p>which in its turn, are going to get more and more unpredictable response time,</p>
<p>and we’re get ourselves in what is known as a race condition. And this race condition we </p>
<p>very often call a connection<br>storm, when basically we’re initiating a</p>
<p>storm of  connection requests but we are actually getting </p>
<p>nothing back. And remember what was shown in previous YouTubes</p>
<p>the actually logging on and off the database is quite an expensive operation.</p>
<p>So this just compounds this effect, and we start going into a spiral of degrading</p>
<p>performance.</p>
<p>So I’m going to not double the performance at this point in time.</p>
<p>Because as you can see it’s been quite well behaved. We’ve got over</p>
<p>2000 connections to the database at this<br>point. But what we’re going to do this we do</p>
<p>is we are going to do it in smaller increments.</p>
<p>So instead of doubling it, I’m just gonna</p>
<p>take it up to four hundred milliseconds, so<br>0.4 percent of a second between each mouse clicks.</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>some fairly serious card players. And</p>
<p>we are just going to jump the workload up a little bit more.</p>
<p>And you can see that basically, suddenly the small increment in work suddenly</p>
<p>caused</p>
<p>quite an impact on the system, okay?</p>
<p>So almost like a 50 percent increase in the<br>workload, we saw almost</p>
<p>twice as much CPU. We see this disproportional response in CPU utilization</p>
<p>getting extremely busy. We’re not seeing<br>proportional</p>
<p>increase in the transaction rate, and<br>we’re now starting to see the</p>
<p>transaction rate</p>
<p>starting to become quite choppy. And we are starting to see</p>
<p>queuing in the middle tier machine. And we’re seeing extended database response times.</p>
<p>And for the first time, we are actually starting to see wait events</p>
<p>inside the database through the ASH<br>reports.</p>
<p>And some of you may have seen some of these</p>
<p>wait events in your life before. Latches on end queues,</p>
<p>row cache objects, latch free </p>
<p>enq:TX index contention, buffer busy waits.</p>
<p>Quite common wait events as and well, we getting to the situation where we’re  starting to</p>
<p>oversubscribe the machine, but the CPU<br>is starting to get extremely busy.</p>
<p>And we’re starting to see more and more wait events. We are starting to see the CPU get busier</p>
<p>and busier.</p>
<p>And you can see now that the database<br>connection pool</p>
<p>that was at 2000 is now approaching 6000.</p>
<p>Remember we have a limit here of 6144.</p>
<p>So very quickly, we’re actually getting<br>to the situation where we are approaching our</p>
<p>connection limits.</p>
<p>And you’ll notice the number of active connections on the database</p>
<p>is massively oversubscribed, compared to<br>the number</p>
<p>of cores on the system. It’s now telling me I have</p>
<p>6,000 active requests into the database</p>
<p>at this point in time. As a result you can<br>actually see</p>
<p>we’ve completely oversubscribed the machine so the response time</p>
<p>has gone out of control, the wait event<br>inside the database has gone</p>
<p>completely out of control. Just<br>looking at that you can see</p>
<p>enq:TX index contention, contention events</p>
<p>and the throughput is dropped right off.</p>
<p>And in fact what we’re starting to see<br>is the monitoring of the thing</p>
<p>is starting to become unpredictable. And<br>even in fact the CPU has dropped off</p>
<p>because this machine has now actually rendered itself completely unstable.</p>
<p>And at this point in time, we’ve<br>actually</p>
<p>simulated a failure in the system.</p>
<p>And then sometimes it starts to recover and it’s erratically</p>
<p>you can see the trajectory sometimes<br>bounce-back, but</p>
<p>effectively what we’ve done is hang<br>the system.</p>
<p>And trying to use a keyboard and things like this</p>
<p>becomes impossible. So getting debugging<br>information on such a system</p>
<p>into this state becomes next to<br>impossible.</p>
