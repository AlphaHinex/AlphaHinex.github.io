Analyzing Business Domains</h2><h3 id="What-Is-a-Business-Domain"><a href="#What-Is-a-Business-Domain" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Business Domain?"></a>What Is a Business Domain?</h3><blockquote>
<p>A business domain defines a company’s main area of activity. Generally speaking, it’s the service the company provides to its clients.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="What-Is-a-Subdomain"><a href="#What-Is-a-Subdomain" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Subdomain?"></a>What Is a Subdomain?</h3><blockquote>
<p>A subdomain is a fine-grained area of business activity. All of a company’s subdomains form its business domain: the service it provides to its customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The subdomains have to interact with each other to achieve the company’s goals in its business domain.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="Types-of-Subdomains"><a href="#Types-of-Subdomains" class="headerlink" title="Types of Subdomains"></a>Types of Subdomains</h4><blockquote>
<p>… subdomains bear different strategic/business values. Domain-driven design distinguishes between three types of subdomains: core, generic, and supporting.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Core subdomains</strong></p>
<p>A core subdomain is what a company does differently from its competitors. This may involve inventing new products or services or reducing costs by optimizing existing processes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Complexity.</strong> A core subdomain that is simple to implement can only provide a short-lived competitive advantage. Therefore, core subdomains are naturally complex.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sources of competitive advantage.</strong> It’s important to note that core subdomains are not necessarily technical. Not all business problems are solved through algorithms or other technical solutions. A company’s competitive advantage can come from various sources.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider, for example, a jewelry maker selling its products online. The online shop is important, but it’s not a core subdomain. The jewelry design is.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Core Subdomain Versus Core Domain</strong></p>
<p>Core subdomains are also called core domains. For example, in the original domain-driven design book, Eric Evans uses “core subdomain” and “core domain” interchangeably. Although the term “core domain” is used often, I prefer to use “core subdomain” for a number of reasons. First, it is a subdomain, and I prefer to avoid confusion with business domains. Second, as you will learn in Chapter 11, it’s not uncommon for subdomains to evolve over time and change their types. For example, a core subdomain can turn into a generic subdomain. Hence, saying that “a generic subdomain has evolved into a core subdomain” is more straightforward than saying “a generic subdomain has evolved into a core domain.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Generic subdomains</strong></p>
<p>Generic subdomains are business activities that all companies are performing in the same way. Like core subdomains, generic subdomains are generally complex and hard to implement. However, generic subdomains do not provide any competitive edge for the company. There is no need for innovation or optimization here: battle-tested implementations are widely available, and all companies use them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, most systems need to authenticate and authorize their users. Instead of inventing a proprietary authentication mechanism, it makes more sense to use an existing solution. Such a solution is likely to be more reliable and secure since it has already been tested by many other companies that have the same needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Supporting subdomains</strong></p>
<p>As the name suggests, supporting subdomains support the company’s business. However, contrary to core subdomains, supporting subdomains do not provide any competitive advantage.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The distinctive characteristic of supporting subdomains is the complexity of the solution’s business logic. Supporting subdomains are simple.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These activity areas do not provide any competitive advantage for the company, and therefore do not require high entry barriers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="Comparing-Subdomains"><a href="#Comparing-Subdomains" class="headerlink" title="Comparing Subdomains"></a>Comparing Subdomains</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>Competitive advantage</strong></p>
<p>Only core subdomains provide a competitive advantage to a company. Core subdomains are the company’s strategy for differentiating itself from its competitors.</p>
<p>Generic subdomains, by definition, cannot be a source for any competitive advantage. These are generic solutions—the same solutions used by the company and its competitors.</p>
<p>Supporting subdomains have low entry barriers and cannot provide a competitive advantage either. Usually, a company wouldn’t mind its competitors copying its supporting subdomains—this won’t affect its competitiveness in the industry. On the contrary, strategically the company would prefer its supporting subdomains to be generic, ready-made solutions, thus eliminating the need to design and build their implementation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At times it may be challenging to differentiate between core and supporting subdomains. Complexity is a useful guiding principle. Ask whether the subdomain in question can be turned into a side business. Would someone pay for it on its own? If so, this is a core subdomain. Similar reasoning applies for differentiating supporting and generic subdomains: would it be simpler and cheaper to hack your own implementation, rather than integrating an external one? If so, this is a supporting subdomain.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The chart in Figure 1-1 represents the interplay between the three types of subdomains in terms of business differentiation and business logic complexity. The intersection between the supporting and generic subdomains is a gray area: it can go either way. If a generic solution exists for a supporting subdomain’s functionality, the resultant subdomain type depends on whether it’s simpler and/or cheaper to integrate the generic solution than it is to implement the functionality from scratch.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/contents/learning-domain-driven-design/1-1.png" alt="Figure 1-1. The business differentiation and business logic complexity of the three types of subdomains"></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Volatility</strong></p>
<p>… core subdomains can change often.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Contrary to the core subdomains, supporting subdomains do not change often.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite having existing solutions, generic subdomains can change over time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since core subdomains’ requirements are expected to change often and continuously, the solution must be maintainable and easy to evolve. Thus, core subdomains require implementation of the most advanced engineering techniques.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since generic subdomains are hard but already solved problems, it’s more cost-effective to buy an off-the-shelf product or adopt an open source solution than invest time and effort into implementing a generic subdomain in-house.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lack of competitive advantage makes it reasonable to avoid implementing supporting subdomains in-house. However, unlike generic subdomains, no ready-made solutions are available. So, a company has no choice but to implement supporting subdomains itself. That said, the simplicity of the business logic and infrequency of changes make it easy to cut corners.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Supporting subdomains do not require elaborate design patterns or other advanced engineering techniques. A rapid application development framework will suffice to implement the business logic without introducing accidental complexities.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From a staffing perspective, supporting subdomains do not require highly skilled technical aptitude and provide a great opportunity to train up-and-coming talent. Save the engineers on your team who are experienced in tackling complex challenges for the core subdomains. Finally, the simplicity of the business logic makes supporting subdomains a good candidate for outsourcing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h4 id="Identifying-Subdomain-Boundaries"><a href="#Identifying-Subdomain-Boundaries" class="headerlink" title="Identifying Subdomain Boundaries"></a>Identifying Subdomain Boundaries</h4><blockquote>
<p>We can use the definition of “subdomains as a set of coherent use cases” as a guiding principle for when to stop looking for finer-grained subdomains. These are the most precise boundaries of the subdomains.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Focus on the essentials</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When looking for subdomains, it’s important to identify business functions that are not related to software, acknowledge them as such, and focus on aspects of the business that are relevant to the software system you are working on.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, domain experts are either the people coming up with requirements or the software’s end users. The software is supposed to solve their problems.</p>

<p>Using a ubiquitous language is the cornerstone practice of domain-driven design. The idea is simple and straightforward: if parties need to communicate efficiently, instead of relying on translations, they have to speak the same language.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Language-of-the-Business"><a href="#Language-of-the-Business" class="headerlink" title="Language of the Business"></a>Language of the Business</h3><blockquote>
<p>It’s crucial to emphasize that the ubiquitous language is the language of the business. As such, it should consist of business domain–related terms only. No technical jargon! </p>

<p>A model is a simplified representation of a thing or phenomenon that intentionally emphasizes certain aspects while ignoring others. Abstraction with a specific use in mind.</p>

<h4 id="Effective-Modeling"><a href="#Effective-Modeling" class="headerlink" title="Effective Modeling"></a>Effective Modeling</h4><blockquote>
<p>… a useful model is not a copy of the real world. Instead, a model is intended to solve a problem, and it should provide just enough information for that purpose.</p>

<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><blockquote>
<p>Tools such as wiki-based glossaries and Gherkin tests can greatly alleviate the process of documenting and maintaining a ubiquitous language. However, the main prerequisite for an effective ubiquitous language is usage: the language has to be used consistently in all project-related communications.</p>

Managing Domain Complexity</h2><h3 id="What-Is-a-Bounded-Context"><a href="#What-Is-a-Bounded-Context" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Bounded Context?"></a>What Is a Bounded Context?</h3><blockquote>
<p>The solution in domain-driven design is trivial: divide the ubiquitous language into multiple smaller languages, then assign each one to the explicit context in which it can be applied: its bounded context.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="Model-Boundaries"><a href="#Model-Boundaries" class="headerlink" title="Model Boundaries"></a>Model Boundaries</h4><blockquote>
<p>A model cannot exist without a boundary; it will expand to become a copy of the real world. That makes defining a model’s boundary—its bounded contexts—an intrinsic part of the modeling process.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A language’s terminology, principles, and business rules are only consistent inside its bounded context.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Bounded-Contexts-Versus-Subdomains"><a href="#Bounded-Contexts-Versus-Subdomains" class="headerlink" title="Bounded Contexts Versus Subdomains"></a>Bounded Contexts Versus Subdomains</h3><h4 id="The-Interplay-Between-Subdomains-and-Bounded-Contexts"><a href="#The-Interplay-Between-Subdomains-and-Bounded-Contexts" class="headerlink" title="The Interplay Between Subdomains and Bounded Contexts"></a>The Interplay Between Subdomains and Bounded Contexts</h4><blockquote>
<p>It’s crucial to remember that subdomains are discovered and bounded contexts are designed. The subdomains are defined by the business strategy. However, we can design the software solution and its bounded contexts to address the specific project’s context and constraints.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Boundaries"><a href="#Boundaries" class="headerlink" title="Boundaries"></a>Boundaries</h3><blockquote>
<p>As Ruth Malan says, architectural design is inherently about boundaries:</p>
<p>Architectural design is system design. System design is contextual design—it is inherently about boundaries (what’s in, what’s out, what spans, what moves between), and about trade-offs. It reshapes what is outside, just as it shapes what is inside.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="Physical-Boundaries"><a href="#Physical-Boundaries" class="headerlink" title="Physical Boundaries"></a>Physical Boundaries</h4><blockquote>
<p>As we discussed earlier, a bounded context can contain multiple subdomains. In such a case, the bounded context is a physical boundary, while each of its subdomains is a logical boundary. Logical boundaries bear different names in different programming languages: namespaces, modules, or packages.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="Ownership-Boundaries"><a href="#Ownership-Boundaries" class="headerlink" title="Ownership Boundaries"></a>Ownership Boundaries</h4><blockquote>
<p>A bounded context should be implemented, evolved, and maintained by one team only. No two teams can work on the same bounded context.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s important to note that the relationship between teams and bounded contexts is one-directional: a bounded context should be owned by only one team. However, a single team can own multiple bounded contexts, as Figure 3-8 illustrates.<br><img src="/contents/learning-domain-driven-design/3-8.png" alt="Figure 3-8. Team 1 working on the Marketing and Optimization bounded contexts, while Team 2 works on the Sales bounded context"></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Chapter-4-Integrating-Bounded-Contexts"><a href="#Chapter-4-Integrating-Bounded-Contexts" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 4. Integrating Bounded Contexts"></a>Chapter 4. Integrating Bounded Contexts</h2><blockquote>
<p>Moreover, models in different bounded contexts can be evolved and implemented independently. That said, bounded contexts themselves are not independent. Just as a system cannot be built out of independent components—the components have to interact with one another to achieve the system’s overarching goals—so, too, do the implementations in bounded contexts. Although they can evolve independently, they have to integrate with one another. As a result, there will always be touchpoints between bounded contexts. These are called contracts.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Cooperation"><a href="#Cooperation" class="headerlink" title="Cooperation"></a>Cooperation</h3><blockquote>
<p>… two DDD patterns suitable for cooperating teams: the partnership and shared kernel patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="Partnership"><a href="#Partnership" class="headerlink" title="Partnership"></a>Partnership</h4><blockquote>
<p>The coordination of integration here is two-way.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="Shared-Kernel"><a href="#Shared-Kernel" class="headerlink" title="Shared Kernel"></a>Shared Kernel</h4><blockquote>
<p>Despite bounded contexts being model boundaries, there still can be cases when the same model of a subdomain, or a part of it, will be implemented in multiple bounded contexts.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The supplier’s public interface is not intended to conform to its ubiquitous language. Instead, it is intended to expose a protocol convenient for the consumers, expressed in an integration-oriented language. As such, the public protocol is called the published language.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In a sense, the open-host service pattern is a reversal of the anticorruption layer pattern: instead of the consumer, the supplier implements the translation of its internal model.</p>

<p>The separate ways pattern should be avoided when integrating core subdomains. Duplicating the implementation of such subdomains would defy the company’s strategy to implement them in the most effective and optimized way.</p>

<p>Bounded contexts are not independent. They have to interact with one another. The following patterns define different ways bounded contexts can be integrated:</p>
<p>Partnership</p>
<p>Bounded contexts are integrated in an ad hoc manner.</p>
<p>Shared kernel</p>
<p>Two or more bounded contexts are integrated by sharing a limited overlapping model that belongs to all participating bounded contexts.</p>
<p>Conformist</p>

<p>The active record pattern is also known as an anemic domain model antipattern; in other words, an improperly designed domain model. I prefer to restrain from the negative connotation of the words anemic and antipattern. This pattern is a tool. Like any tool, it can solve problems, but it can potentially introduce more harm than good when applied in the wrong context. There is nothing wrong with using active records when the business logic is simple. Furthermore, using a more elaborate pattern when implementing simple business logic will also result in harm by introducing accidental complexity. In the next chapter, you will learn what a domain model is and how it differs from an active record pattern.</p>

<p>Transaction script</p>
<p>This pattern organizes the system’s operations as simple, straightforward procedural scripts. The procedures ensure that each operation is transactional—either it succeeds or it fails. The transaction script pattern lends itself to supporting subdomains, with business logic resembling simple, ETL-like operations.</p>

<p><strong>Value object</strong></p>
<p>A value object is an object that can be identified by the composition of its values.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>… value objects eliminate the need for conventions —- for example, the need to keep in mind that this string is an email and the other string is a phone number —- and instead makes using the object model less error prone and more intuitive.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since a change to any of the fields of a value object results in a different value, value objects are implemented as immutable objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When to use value objects.</strong> The simple answer is, whenever you can. Not only do value objects make the code more expressive and encapsulate business logic that tends to spread apart, but the pattern makes the code safer. Since value objects are immutable, the value objects’ behavior is free of side effects and is thread safe.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From a business domain perspective, a useful rule of thumb is to use value objects for the domain’s elements that describe properties of other objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The examples you saw earlier used value objects to describe a person, including their ID, name, phone numbers, email, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An especially important opportunity to introduce a value object is when modeling money and other monetary values. Relying on primitive types to represent money not only limits your ability to encapsulate all money-related business logic in one place, but also often leads to dangerous bugs, such as rounding errors and other precision-related issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Entities</strong></p>
<p>An entity is the opposite of a value object. It requires an explicit identification field to distinguish between the different instances of the entity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/contents/learning-domain-driven-design/6-2.png" alt="Figure 6-2. Introducing an explicit identification field, allowing differentiating instances of the object even if the values of all other fields are identical"></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Contrary to value objects, entities are not immutable and are expected to change. Another difference between entities and value objects is that value objects describe an entity’s properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Entities are an essential building block of any business domain.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>… we don’t implement entities independently, but only in the context of the aggregate pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Aggregates</strong></p>
<p>An aggregate is an entity: it requires an explicit identification field and its state is expected to change during an instance’s lifecycle. However, it is much more than just an entity. The goal of the pattern is to protect the consistency of its data. Since an aggregate’s data is mutable, there are implications and challenges that the pattern has to address to keep its state consistent at all times.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An aggregate’s public interface is responsible for validating the input and enforcing all of the relevant business rules and invariants. This strict boundary also ensures that all business logic related to the aggregate is implemented in one place: the aggregate itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A change to an aggregate’s state can only be committed individually, one aggregate per database transaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To support changes to multiple objects that have to be applied in one atomic transaction, the aggregate pattern resembles a hierarchy of entities, all sharing transactional consistency</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s why the pattern is named “aggregate”: it aggregates business entities and value objects that belong to the same transaction boundary.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Only the information that is required by the aggregate’s business logic to be strongly consistent should be a part of the aggregate. All information that can be eventually consistent should reside outside of the aggregate’s boundary;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The rule of thumb is to keep the aggregates as small as possible and include only objects that are required to be in a strongly consistent state by the aggregate’s business logic</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To decide whether an entity belongs to an aggregate or not, examine whether the aggregate contains business logic that can lead to an invalid system state if it will work on eventually consistent data.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to the aggregate root’s public interface, there is another mechanism through which the outer world can communicate with aggregates: domain events.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Domain events are part of an aggregate’s public interface. An aggregate publishes its domain events. Other processes, aggregates, or even external systems can subscribe to and execute their own logic in response to the domain events</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Domain services</strong></p>
<p>Sooner or later, you may encounter business logic that either doesn’t belong to any aggregate or value object, or that seems to be relevant to multiple aggregates. In such cases, domain-driven design proposes to implement the logic as a domain service.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A domain service is a stateless object that implements the business logic.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="Managing-Complexity"><a href="#Managing-Complexity" class="headerlink" title="Managing Complexity"></a>Managing Complexity</h4><blockquote>
<p>… when discussing the complexity of a system we are interested in evaluating the difficulty of controlling and predicting the system’s behavior. These two aspects are reflected by the system’s degrees of freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s what both aggregate and value object patterns do: encapsulate invariants and thus reduce complexity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All the business logic related to the state of a value object is located in its boundaries. The same is true for aggregates. An aggregate can only be modified by its own methods. Its business logic encapsulates and protects business invariants, thus reducing the degrees of freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the domain model pattern is applied only for subdomains with complex business logic, it’s safe to assume that these are core subdomains—the heart of the software.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><blockquote>
<p>The domain model pattern is aimed at cases of complex business logic. It consists of three main building blocks:</p>
<p>Value objects</p>
<p>Concepts of the business domain that can be identified exclusively by their values and thus do not require an explicit ID field. Since a change in one of the fields semantically creates a new value, value objects are immutable.</p>
<p>Value objects model not only data, but behavior as well: methods manipulating the values and thus initializing new value objects.</p>
<p>Aggregates</p>
<p>A hierarchy of entities sharing a transactional boundary. All of the data included in an aggregate’s boundary has to be strongly consistent to implement its business logic.</p>
<p>The state of the aggregate, and its internal objects, can only be modified through its public interface, by executing the aggregate’s commands. The data fields are read-only for external components for the sake of ensuring that all the business logic related to the aggregate resides in its boundaries.</p>
<p>The aggregate acts as a transactional boundary. All of its data, including all of its internal objects, has to be committed to the database as one atomic transaction.</p>
<p>An aggregate can communicate with external entities by publishing domain events—messages describing important business events in the aggregate’s lifecycle. Other components can subscribe to the events and use them to trigger the execution of business logic.</p>
<p>Domain services</p>
<p>A stateless object that hosts business logic that naturally doesn’t belong to any of the domain model’s aggregates or value objects.</p>

<p>However, the pattern makes it challenging to implement a domain model. In a domain model, the business entities (aggregates and value objects) should have no dependency and no knowledge of the underlying infrastructure. The layered architec‐ ture’s top-down dependency requires jumping through some hoops to fulfill this requirement. It is still possible to implement a domain model in a layered architec‐ ture, but the pattern we will discuss next fits much better.</p>

<p>Deciding on the business logic implementation pattern according to the complexity of the business logic and its data structures is a way to validate your assumptions about the subdomain type.

<li>The domain model requires the ports &amp; adapters architecture. Otherwise, the layered architecture makes it hard to make aggregates and value objects ignorant of persistence.</li>
<li>The Active record pattern is best accompanied by a layered architecture with the additional application (service) layer. This is for the logic controlling the active records.</li>

<p>To design a proper microservices-based system, we have to optimize both global and local complexities.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><blockquote>
<p>All microservices are bounded contexts, but not all bounded contexts are necessarily microservices. In its essence, a microservice defines the smallest valid boundary of a service, while a bounded context protects the consistency of the encompassed model and represents the widest valid boundaries. Defining boundaries to be wider than their bounded contexts will result in a big ball of mud, while boundaries that are smaller than microservices will lead to a distributed big ball of mud.</p>

<p>Although both event-driven architecture and event sourcing are based on events, the two patterns are conceptually different. EDA refers to the communication between services, while event sourcing happens inside a service.</p>

<p>There are two types of messages:</p>
<p>Event</p>
<p>A message describing a change that has already happened</p>
<p>Command</p>
<p>A message describing an operation that has to be carried out</p>
<p>An event is something that has already happened, whereas a command is an instruction to do something. Both events and commands can be communicated asynchronously as messages. However, a command can be rejected: the command’s target can refuse to execute the command, for example, if the command is invalid or if it contradicts the system’s business rules. A recipient of an event, on the other hand, cannot cancel the event. The event describes something that has already happened. The only thing that can be done to overturn an event is to issue a compensating action—a command, as it’s carried out in the saga pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="Types-of-Events"><a href="#Types-of-Events" class="headerlink" title="Types of Events"></a>Types of Events</h4><blockquote>
<p>Events can be categorized into one of three types:2 event notification, event-carried state transfer, or domain events.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Event-carried state transfer (ECST) messages notify subscribers about changes in the producer’s internal state. Contrary to event notification messages, ECST messages include all the data reflecting the change in the state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Conceptually, using event-carried state transfer messages is an asynchronous data replication mechanism.</p>

<p>Use this as a guiding principle when designing event-driven systems:</p>

<li>The network is going to be slow.</li>
<li>Servers will fail at the most inconvenient moment.</li>
<li>Events will arrive out of order.</li>
<li>Events will be duplicated.</li>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ensure that the events are always delivered consistently, no matter what:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the outbox pattern to publish messages reliably.</li>
<li>When publishing messages, ensure that the subscribers will be able to deduplicate the messages and identify and reorder out-of-order messages.</li>
<li>Leverage the saga and process manager patterns when orchestrating cross- bounded context processes that require issuing compensating actions.</li>
